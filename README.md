LangChain supports two types of models:

- **2 types of language models**
- **Language Models (LLMs):** These are text-in, text-out models used for applications like chatbots and AI agents. it sloves the problem of NLU & CATG
- **CHAT MODELS:. A Chat Model is an LLM fine-tuned specifically for conversation, using dialogue history and instruction-following to provide interactive, coherent, and context-aware responses, such as in chatbots or virtual assistants**
